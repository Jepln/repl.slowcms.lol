repl.slowcms.lol is my playground testing website, you will see  many updates on it, and I will add many more projects on it. Once I add CSS it will look much cleaner.

## Detailed description
##### *****Found on the main page*****

This website was made for the sole purpose of testing out projects before adding them to the main project page of my website. This worked, however Replit was unable to handle all my projects and it bottlenecked my CPU and RAM(I didn't want to pay money for extra). Anyhow, I've purged many of my fallen projects and only a few remain down below. Think of this site as an alternate reality portal where everything is different, the colors, the theme, E.T.C. On top of that, this website will also be updated way more frequently as I can access my replit account from anywhere.


## How does this benefit you?
- I don't crash my main website
- I can log-in to my Replit account anywhere
- Replit is somewhat easier to use than cPanel

## Why did you make this?
- Projects
- Fun
- Testing
- Extension
- Good way to teach myself how to code
